    "One of a Data Scientist's jobs is to help others determine what's  meaningful information and what's not. You can think about this as distinguishing between **signal** and **noise**. As the author [Nate Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Signal_and_the_Noise) puts it, \"The signal is the truth. The noise is what distracts us from the truth.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In our experiment, we're looking for a signal indicating that applicants who receive an email are more likely to complete the admissions quiz. If signal's strong, it'll be easy to see. A much higher number of applicants in our treatment group will complete the quiz. But if the signal's weak and there's only a tiny change in quiz completion, it will be harder to determine if this is a meaningful difference or just random variation. How can we separate signal from noise in this case? The answer is **statistical power**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what statistical power is, let's imagine that we're radio engineers building an antenna. The size of our antenna would depend on the type of signal we wanted to detect. It would be OK to build a low-power antenna if we only wanted to detect strong signals, like a car antenna that picks up your favorite local music station. But our antenna wouldn't pick up weaker signals â€” like a radio station on the other side of the globe. For weaker signals, we'd need something with higher power. In statistics, power comes from the number of observations you include in your experiment. In other words, the more people we include, the stronger our antenna, and the better we can detect weak signals. \n",
